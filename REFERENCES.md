- ## Auth Workflow

  - Redirecting the user to the oauth endpoint with the scopes and all the other required things
  - Getting the token in the callback or throwing an error
  - from that callback - going to the auth url to fetch the details about the user and almost creating the user to get the username for the creation of the user - redirection
